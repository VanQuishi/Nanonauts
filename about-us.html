			<h2>Daniel - Singer extraodinaire</h2>
			<p><img src="images/Downloads/NINJA_BLUE.png" alt="Picture of Daniel"/></p>
			<p>Daniel is the Nanonauts's singer. He likes to sing all the time 
			- not just when he's playing with the nanonauts! His mom and dad say he learned to sing 
			before he learned to talk!</p>
			<p>Daniel also plays clarinet and is learning the alto saxophone.</p>

			<h2>Sam - One-man rhythm section</h2>
			<p><img class="small" src="images/Downloads/NINJA_GREEN.png"/></p>
			<p>On some songs Sam plays the bass guitar and on some songs the drums. He loves playing in the Nanonauts but hates carrying his drum kit around.</p>

			<h2>Holly - If it's got strings, she'll play it</h2>
			<p><img class="small" src="images/Downloads/NINJA_YELLOW.png"/></p>
			<p>She started off by making homemade guitars from cardboard boxes and elastic bands until her uncle
			took pity on her and bought her a Spanish guiter for Christmas. After a few lessons at school she was flying!</p>
